Jupyter notebooks describing concepts from quantum mechanics.

## [AiryWaveFcns](AiryWaveFcns.ipynb)

A notebook which outlines the problem of the quantum bouncing ball and the more general problem of the symmetric linear potential well.

## [GeneralNumerov](GeneralNumerov.ipynb)
A notebook which introduces and performs the Numerov method for computationally solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation for arbitrary potential energy functions.

## [SHOqmvscl](SHOqmvscl.ipynb)

A similar notebook to AiryWaveFcns.ipynb. As the name suggests, it was initially created to compare the classical and quantum probability distributions of the simple harmonic oscillator for various values of *n*.
